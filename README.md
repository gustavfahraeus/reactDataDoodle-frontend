# reactDataDoodle
👋 This is a project I built to learn the ropes of React front-end web development! ⚛️

[reactDataDoodle](https://reactdatadoodle.netlify.app) is a web application where you can find some of your personal Spotify stats such as your top artists, top tracks, and top genres. 🎶

It is connected to a Node.js server which handles the Spotify authentication ([reactDataDoodle-OAuth](https://github.com/gustavfahraeus/reactdatadoodle-oauth)), as well as a Python Flask server which handles a connection to a MongoDB database ([reactDataDoodle-flask](https://github.com/gustavfahraeus/reactDataDoodle-flask)). I aim to use the data I collect within a machine learning algorithm to offer music recommendations that the user hopefully likes. I have as of writing this just finished taking a data mining course at Utrecht University, and I intend to use the knowledge I have gathered during the course to achieve this. 🤖
